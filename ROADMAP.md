## Accumulated Tech Debt

- The `test_list_files_command` in `tests/unit/test_cli.py` is currently skipped due to a `FileNotFoundError`. This issue needs to be resolved to ensure proper testing of the `list-files` command.
- **ty Error in `test_drive_file_creation`:** The type checker (`ty`) reports a false positive error in `tests/unit/drive/test_models.py` regarding missing arguments for `DriveFile.__init__`. This is due to `ty`'s pre-release status and limitations in static analysis. The test is correct, and the error can be ignored for now. Future updates to `ty` may resolve this issue.
- **Minor coverage gaps:** 3 lines in `commands.py` (lines 94, 193-194) remain uncovered due to specific edge cases that are difficult to trigger in tests. These are low-priority and don't affect functionality.

## Project Health Summary

- **Test Coverage:** 95.67% (exceeds 80% requirement)
- **Documentation:** Complete with Sphinx-generated API docs and comprehensive user guides
- **Code Quality:** High standards maintained with ruff formatting, ty type checking, and Google-style docstrings
- **Feature Completeness:** Core file management and export features fully implemented
- **User Experience:** Interactive CLI with smart defaults and comprehensive error handling
- **Architecture:** Well-structured modular design ready for library transformation
